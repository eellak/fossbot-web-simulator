## :calendar: Project Timeline

Below is the project timeline structured according to the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

## Phase 1 (May 26 - Jun 17)

In this initial phase, the project is set in motion by immersing into essential preparatory tasks and creating the foundational elements.

- Familiarizing myself with the Godot documentation.
- Becoming a member of the Godot community server.
- Designing the Blender model for the fossbot in Godot.
- Creating the first accurate and functional version of the fossbot model in Godot.
- Performing initial precision and reliability tests of the fossbot model.

## Phase 2 (Jun 18 - Jul 27)

During this phase, the focus shifts to enhancing the core model and advancing the infrastructure that supports the fossbot simulator along with its essential functionalities.

- Elevating the precision and functionality of the virtual fossbot model.
- Addressing issues and bugs.
- Developing the Flask-Socketio Server.
- Creating a Python Library for the new fossbot simulator.
- Establishing a message routing mechanism for multiple fossbots.
- Devising a mechanism for procedurally generating levels.

## Phase 3 (Jul 28 - Aug 26)

This phase concludes preparations for smooth software deployment and course material integration. It involves creating user manuals, instructional guides, and course materials, alongside developing a dedicated JavaScript Library for the new fossbot simulator.

- Finalizing fossbot model enhancements and message routing.
- Creating JavaScript Library for new fossbot simulator.
- Developing Python scripts for predefined level examples within the simulator.
- Continuously improving the mechanism for level generation.
- Completing the debugging process.
- Creating a comprehensive Wiki page to document the project's progress and details.
